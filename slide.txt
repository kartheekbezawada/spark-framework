Title: Data Migration in Azure Databricks using Delta Lake
Subtitle: Implementation and Unit Testing Overview
Presented by: [Your Name]

Slide 2: Introduction

Title: Project Overview

Objective: Seamless migration of data from Azure SQL MI to Delta Lake.

Technologies: PySpark, Delta Lake, Azure Key Vault, Azure SQL MI.

Slide 3: Architecture Overview

Title: System Architecture

Source: Azure SQL Managed Instance

Destination: Delta Lake on Azure Data Lake Storage

Tools: PySpark for data processing, Azure Key Vault for secure credential management.

Slide 4: Code Structure

Title: Code Overview

Class: DataMigration

Initialize Spark Session and environment configurations.

Methods for reading from SQL, writing to Delta Lake.

Handles both full and incremental data loads.

Slide 5: Key Functionalities

Title: Key Functionalities

Full Data Load: Reads entire tables and writes to Delta Lake.

Incremental Load: Fetches only new/updated data based on a column.

Partitioned Reads/Writes: Optimizes large data operations using partitions.

Slide 6: Incremental Data Handling

Title: Handling Incremental Loads

Retrieve last maximum value from Delta Lake.

Query Azure SQL MI for records greater than the max value.

Write incremental data to Delta Lake with partitioning.

Slide 7: Unit Testing Overview

Title: Unit Testing Strategy

Framework: Python's unittest

Mocking: Using unittest.mock to mock external services (Azure, Databricks).

Test Coverage: Initialization, data read/write operations, incremental logic.

Slide 8: Sample Unit Tests

Title: Example Unit Tests

Test Spark session initialization.

Test reading from Azure SQL MI with mocked data.

Test writing to Delta Lake with partitioning.

Test incremental load logic.

Slide 9: Results & Validation

Title: Test Results & Validation

All unit tests executed successfully.

Ensures robust data migration with error handling and retries.

Scalable for both small dimension tables and large fact tables.

Slide 10: Conclusion

Title: Summary & Next Steps

Efficient data migration pipeline established.

Secure and scalable architecture using Azure services.

Future Enhancements:

Add logging and monitoring.

Implement error retries and notifications.

Thank You!
